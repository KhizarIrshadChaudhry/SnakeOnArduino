# Snake On Arduino - An Arduino Based Snake Game
This repo contains code for my 1st year technology project.

## The Project
Snake On Arduino is an arduino project, where I managed to run the game Snake oon a 8x8 matrix. While being able to play it with a IR-remote. The project also contained two 7-segment displays, displaying the games points.
